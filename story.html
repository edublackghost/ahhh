                        <p> In a far future,
                            Where pigeons and penguins rule the world... </p> 

                        <p> "The war will never stop at this point, more animals try to conquer land 
                            but the penguin kingdom and the powerful pigeons seem to be undefeted.
                            There are rumers saying the only place where war doesn't occur is greenland,
                            everyone seeks to reside and build habitations.
                            You might be asking why nobody yet reached Greenland, simple, let's 
                            take a step back to the past.
                        </p> 
                        <p> A rebellion of pigeons in Germany and Belarus took possessions of a group
                            of humans to make a serie of experiments to turn themselves into humanoids 
                            therefore they could easily conquer the planet.
                            Their plan turned out to be a success, there was one only problem, the penguins
                            found out about the experiments and threatened the pigeons to reveal the plans 
                            to the humans if they wouldn't run the tests also to the penguin kingdom, 
                            the pigeons had no choice and turned 50% of their enemies into humanoids.   
                         </p>  
                         <p> 
                            5 YEARS LATER. 
                            The penguins and pigeons are in a costant war after completly sterminating the humans, 
                            the rest of the animals surrandered knowing they had zero chances of winning.
                            The lions and falcons have the most potential on reaching because of the flying abilities of 
                            the falcons and the brave skills of the lions, Greenland is full obstacles only the most trained 
                            ones are able to overtake, but yet anyone was qualified enough to beat such complication."
