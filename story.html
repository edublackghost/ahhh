            <p> In a far future,
                where pigeons and penguins rule the world... </p> 

            <p> "The war will never stop at this point, more and more animals try to conquer land, 
                but the penguins and the powerful pigeons seem to be undefeted.
                There are rumors saying that the only place where war doesn't occur is greenland,
                everyone seeks to reside and build habitations.
                You might be asking why nobody has reached Greenland yet, simple, let's 
                take a step back to the past...
            </p> 
            <p> A rebellion of pigeons in Germany and Belarus took possession of a group
                of humans to make a series of experiments to turn themselves into humanoids, 
                therefore, they could easily conquer the planet.
                Their plan turned out to be a success, there was one only problem, the penguins
                found out about the experiments and threatened to reveal the plans 
                to the humans if they didn't run tests for the penguins too, 
                the pigeons had no choice and ended up turning 50% of their enemies into humanoids.   
                </p>  
                <p> 
                <p> 5 YEARS LATER... 
                The penguins and pigeons are in a costant war after completly sterminating the humans, 
                the rest of the animals surrendered knowing they had zero chances of winning.
                The lions and falcons have the biggest potential of reaching Greenland because of the flying abilities of 
                the falcons and the brave skills of the lions, Greenland is full to the brim with obstacles that only the most trained 
                creatures are able to get past, but no one has been qualified enough to beat such complications so far."
