        In a far future,
       <p> Where pigeons and penguins rule the world...
        The war will never stop at this point, more animals try to conquer land 
        but the penguins and pigeons seem to be undefeted, penguins own asia, oceania
        and also antartica but pigeons took the rest.
        There are rumers saying the only place where war doesn't occur is greenland,
        everyone seeks to reside and build habitations.
        You might be asking why nobody haven't reached Greenland, simple, let's 
        take a step back to the past.</p>
