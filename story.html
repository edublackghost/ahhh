                        In a far future,
                        where pigeons and penguins rule the world...
                        The war will never stop at this point, more animals try to conquer land
                        but the penguins and pigeons seem to be undefeted, penguins own asia, oceania
                        and also antartica but pigeons took the rest.
                        There are rumers saying the only place where war doesn't occur is greenland,
                        everyone seeks to reside and build habitations.
                        You might be asking why folk haven't reached Greenland, simple, let's
                        take a step back to the past.
                        In 2025 a zombie apocalypse and the human species wasn't able to defeat them,
                        in only 10 years the human kind extinguished and every single mortal died
                        a horrible life ate by zombies.
